# Introduction
In today's data-driven world, leveraging data effectively is crucial for the success of any business. This project aims to demonstrate advanced SQL and Python skills through an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, culminating in a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau. The data utilized for this project is sourced from BigQuery public datasets and pertains to an e-commerce company called "TheLook."

### Project Overview:
TheLook is an e-commerce platform that manages various datasets, including users, order_items, orders, products, inventory_items, events, and distribution_centers. These datasets are essential for understanding the business's operations across different departments such as sales, marketing, inventory management, and logistics. By analyzing this data, we can derive valuable insights to drive business decisions and enhance overall performance.

### Objectives:

#### Sales Department:

* Perform sales performance analysis to identify top-selling products and sales trends.
* Conduct customer segmentation to target high-value and loyal customers.

#### Marketing Department:

* Measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns on sales and customer engagement.
* Analyze customer behavior to optimize marketing strategies and improve user experience.

#### Inventory Management Department:

* Monitor and optimize inventory levels to reduce stockouts and overstocking.
* Forecast demand to ensure efficient inventory replenishment.

#### Logistics Department:

* Evaluate order fulfillment performance to identify and address bottlenecks.
* Analyze distribution center efficiency to optimize order delivery.

#### ETL Pipeline:
The ETL pipeline will involve the following steps:

##### Extract:

* Load data from BigQuery public datasets into a staging area for initial processing.

##### Transform:

* Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
* Integrate datasets to create a unified view of the business operations.
* Perform necessary calculations and aggregations to derive actionable insights.

##### Load:

* Load the transformed data into a final destination, such as a SQL database or data warehouse, for further analysis.
* Create interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualize key metrics and trends for stakeholders.

#### Conclusion:
By undertaking this project, I will showcase my proficiency in SQL and Python, demonstrating how these skills can be used to extract meaningful insights from large datasets. Additionally, the Tableau dashboard will provide an intuitive interface for stakeholders to interact with the data and make informed business decisions. This project will not only highlight my technical capabilities but also my ability to translate data into actionable business strategies for TheLook.
